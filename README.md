# semOps: linked data operations flow tool

Right-click to add new nodes.

## Development

```shell
npm install
npm run build
```

Serve `index.html` with a local server. For instance via `npx http-server` or `python3 -m http.server`.


## Feature ideas:
- Backend can be switched out: in-browser session (default), remote triplestore, local java server, etc.
- Export/import flow graph as Turtle file, maybe in line with [RDF Connect](https://github.com/rdf-connect)
- Export an entire ready-to-execute implementation in different programming languages based on the flow graph
- ... your idea?
